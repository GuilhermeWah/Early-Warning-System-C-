#How the system works#

The program analyzes 5 variables within the file “weather.dat”, this file contains 1 variable on
each line with the first line having wind speed, second rainfall, third snowfall, fourth temperature
and fifth has magnitude of a potential earthquake. These variables also get updated every hour
and because of this all file lines will be the same length also the file lines cannot have more than
24 values , ie...all lines will have the same number of values. When the program reads the file
the only value that determines if there is a warning is the last value, this is because the last
value in a line is the most recent value. Once the program is reading the file it will put the
variable values into an array in the class weather. The class weather will store all the values in
the file and has all the warning functions. These warning functions cover a variety of situations
such as blizzard, high winds, or even flooding. The warning functions are only displayed when
the variable values get too extreme. The program can also display a weather report of the day,
and the user can choose to see all values in the file if they please. In addition it also checks for
incorrect variable values such as a negative snowfall or rainfall value
